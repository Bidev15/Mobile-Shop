    <h2> Technology</h2>
   <p>Technology is the result of collective knowledge and the application of skills, methods, and processes utilized in manufacturing and scientific research. For the intended aim of an organization, technology is formed in the operation of all machines, with or without a thorough understanding of their function. Systems are the building blocks of society's technologies. Systems work by taking an input, changing it through a process, and then creating an output that fulfills the system's goal.</p>
   
   <h2>Current status of technology</h2>
   <p> Nepal's history extends back several decades, despite the fact that it is a newcomer to the world of technology. The entrance of second generation IBM 1401 Mainframe computers, which were largely utilized for census calculation, ushered in a new era of technology in Nepal. Mercantile Computers was founded a few decades later, and with it came the internet. Even if technological progress is quickening, it isn't enough to keep up with other countries.

    In terms of technology, Nepal now ranks alongside countries such as Liberia, Ethiopia, Somalia, and others. Lack of energy is the main factor holding Nepal back, followed by an unstable government, a lack of exposure, awareness, and simply ignorance. Despite the fact that Nepal's current condition of ICT is unacceptable, there remains hope. </p>
       
   
   <h4> The Positive and Negative Effects of Technology on Your Life</h4>

        <p>Since then, technological innovation has accelerated, yet one thing has been constant: we are constantly pushed beyond of our comfort zones. However, this is a positive thing. Technology has a positive impact on your social and economic status, as well as several other advantages that have made life easier. In this article, we look at some of the good consequences of technology.</p>  

        <h3> Positives effects of Technology in Our Lives</h3>   

          <b>1. Higher Standards of Security for Organizations : 
            For a long time, password authentication was among the few ways organizations could secure their data. However, hackers become more intelligent as technology advances, and security measures like Aws Key Management service plays an important role in keeping the data safe. One technological advancement that has proven highly effective is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
            
            PKI uses Secure Shell to authenticate all logons and all privileged users accordingly. Not to mention, it allows a safer transfer of information and data over clout and the Internet of Things. That’s not all. PKI is also very cost-effective today, considering that there are many outsourcing options. This means that it’s accessible to both large and small-scale organizations. PKI is also government-approved.<br>
          
          <b>2. Safer Management of Money :
            Technology has also revolutionized how we manage our money. Gone are the days when you’d have to pile up all your receipts to do your taxes or stay on top of your bills. Today, with a few ups and the click of a finger, you can have all your documents in one place, pay your bills and remit your taxes with ease.
            
            
            Furthermore, you don’t have to carry cash with you. Thanks to mobile money wallets, credit cards, and debit cards, your money is safe in your account, and you can transact with ease. Not to mention, investing and tracking your portfolio is so much easier because you can do it right in the comfort of your home. And if you enjoy tracking your money to see where you’re spending it, expense trackers come in handy for that as well.<br>

          <b>3.Fast and Easy Data Retrieval :
            Before the introduction of technology, losing documents was a huge hassle. You’d have to redo the work again because there were minimal ways of retrieving lost data. This isn’t the case today. Whether you’ve accidentally deleted or altered data, you can easily retrieve it by following a few simple steps or using data retrieval software.
            
            Not to mention, there are numerous ways of keeping your data safe. For example, you can backup your data up in the cloud in case your devices crash or get infected by a virus. If you don't have a backup and your device gets infected, computer experts can still help you retrieve your data as well.<br>

         <b>4.Improved and More Effective Advertising Options :
          Technology has also revolutionized the world of advertising. While traditional advertising methods like TV, newspaper, and billboards are still in use today, numerous advancements have changed how people get their products and services in front of their target audience.
          
          
          From Social Media Marketing (SMM) to Search Engine Optimization (SEO), and influencer marketing, there’s no shortage of ways for businesses to build and expand their brand. Google Analytics plays an important role in making a change to your marketing strategy. The best thing about most of these advertising options is that they’re affordable, and anyone can take advantage of them.


          <h3> Negatives effects of Technology in Our Lives</h3>

          While some forms of technology have had great effects on the globe, there is also evidence of technology's detrimental effects and overuse.

          Eye strain and difficulties focusing on crucial tasks may be caused by social media and mobile devices, which can lead to psychological and physical problems. They may also play a role in more significant health issues including depression.
          
          Overuse of technology may have a greater impact on children and teenagers who are still developing.
          
          Learn about the psychological and physical health implications of technology in this article, as well as how to develop healthy technology habits and avoid overuse.<br>

            <b> 1.Isolation :
              Technologies, such as social media, are designed to bring people together, yet they may have the opposite effect in some cases.
              
              A 2017study in young adults aged 19–32 years found that people with higher social media use were more than three times as likely to feel socially isolated than those who did not use social media as often.
              
              Finding ways to reduce social media use, such as setting time limits for social apps, may help reduce feelings of isolation in some people.
              <br>

              <b>2.Depression and anxiety
                The authors of a 2016 systematic reviewTrusted Source discussed the link between social networks and mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety.
                
                Their research found mixed results. People who had more positive interactions and social support on these platforms appeared to have lower levels of depression and anxiety.
                
                However, the reverse was also true. People who perceived that they had more negative social interactions online and who were more prone to social comparison experienced higher levels of depression and anxiety.<br>


              <b>3.Eyestrain
                Technologies, such as handheld tablets, smartphones, and computers, can hold a person’s attention for long periods. This may lead to eyestrain.
                
                Symptoms of digital eyestrain can include blurred vision and dry eyes. Eyestrain may also lead to pains in other areas of the body, such as the head, neck, or shoulders.<br>

         <b> 4. Poor posture
          The way many people use mobile devices and computers may also contribute to incorrect posture. Over time, this may lead to musculoskeletal issues.
          
          Many technologies promote a “down and forward” user position, meaning the person is hunched forward and looking down at the screen. This can put an unnecessary amount of pressure on the neck and spine.
          
          A 5-year study in the journal Applied Ergonomics found an association between texting on a mobile phone and neck or upper back pain in young adults.
